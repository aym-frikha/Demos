#We used those links to make this demo:
- https://www.ubuntu.com/kubernetes/docs/ldap
- https://www.forumsys.com/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/


# To test the integration:
1- Make sure to update aws-credentials.yaml
2- Python aws-controller.py
3- run the script to_bastion.sh
4- get admin.rc file for admin user and put it in the bastion machine
5- source admin.rc
6- execute openstack-commands.sh script in bastion machine
7- update kube-keystone.sh file in bastion machine with right credentials

example:
export OS_AUTH_URL="http://172.31.4.36:5000/v3"
export OS_PROJECT_NAME=k8s
export OS_DOMAIN_NAME=k8s
export OS_USERNAME=Euler
export OS_PASSWORD=password

8- Now you are able to run kubernetes commands
